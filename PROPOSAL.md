# Bellingham, Washington building and address import

*Proposal for Bellingham building and address import. This document is a work-in-progress based on the [DC building import proposal](https://github.com/osmlab/dcbuildings/blob/master/PROPOSAL.md)*

Supporters:

- @almccon

Please review:

- Data conflation
- Upload process
- OSM file quality

**Before reporting issues [review issue queue for existing reports](https://github.com/almccon/bellingham-wa-buildings/issues?state=open).**

## Introduction



## Data

- [Address Points](http://www.cob.org/data/gis/SHP_Files/COB_land_shps.zip)
- [Buildings](http://www.cob.org/data/gis/FGDB_Files/COB_struc_shps.zip)
- [Explicit import permission](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Bellingham,_Washington/GIS_imports)
 
[ include map here ]

## Process

- Process shapefiles into census tract size OSM files
- Review by local community, imports-us and imports working group
- Upload data in a community based process

## User accounts

In compliance with [Import Guidelines](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines#Use_a_dedicated_user_account)
use a separate a user account separate from your regular user account specifically
for this import.

The user name must follow this pattern:

`<regularusername>_bellinghambuildingsaddresses`

So if your user name is `eleanor`, your import user name should be:

`eleanor_bellinghambuildingsaddresses`

## Uploads

The .osm files generated by the conversion scripts are all reviewed manually and then uploaded with JOSM:

1. Open .osm file in JOSM
2. Remove all duplicate buildings
3. Run JOSM validation
4. Address validation warnings and errors
5. Upload under a dedicated upload account

## Timeline

- Proposal review
- Incorporate feedback and test imports 
- Import period

## Conversion code

We have created scripts that process building and address shapefiles into
small chunks of OSM files. They relate addresses to buildings, concatenate
and clean up addresses and export addresses separate from buildings where
more than one address relates to a building. The script simplifies building
polygons and handles multipolygons.

- See all details in the script's [README](https://github.com/almcocn/bellingham-wa-buildings).
